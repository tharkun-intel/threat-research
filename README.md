## 📜 About The Project

Welcome to the digital forge. **0xTharkûn** is a personal research archive dedicated to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), threat hunting, and infrastructure tracking.

This repository serves as the backbone for my blog, where I document my analysis of emerging threats, dissect malicious artifacts, share detection rules and track adversary infrastructure.

### 🎯 Research Focus
* **Threat Hunting:** creating TTP-based detection rules using OSINT sources.
* **Threat Research:** Deobfuscating HTML/JS and identifying exfiltration methods.
* **Infrastructure Tracking:** Pivoting on C2 IPs, SSL certificates, and domains.
* **Phishing Kits:** Deobfuscating HTML/JS and identifying exfiltration methods.
